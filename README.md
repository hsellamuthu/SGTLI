# Sun gravity assist to trans-lunar injection orbits

Using Kustaanheimo-Stiefel Regular Orbit Propagator, transfer to trans-lunar injection orbits under the influence of sun's gravity is computed.
A linear search algorithm is implemented.
The output is initial conditions which satisfy the constraints on delta-V gain from highly elliptical orbits to trans-lunar injection orbits.
